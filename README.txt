To build this project you need freetts available.

 sudo apt-get install freetts

This will make freetts.jar available at /usr/share/java/freetts.jar
or you can download freetts from http://freetts.sourceforge.net/

The freetts library only works under sun java (not openjdk as it seems to hang).

The project is currently being developed with eclipse, however you of course are free to use any dev environment you fancy.

Packaging and redistribution is currently a work in progress.

See launchpad above for all current plans and issues, along with community discussions.
